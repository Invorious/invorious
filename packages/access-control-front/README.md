# access-control-front

This library will contain the logic and the necessary elements (e.g. hooks, handlers, etc.) so that the front end adapts to the back end library, allowing better integration and thus reducing the amount of code that must be created on the client side.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test access-control-front` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
